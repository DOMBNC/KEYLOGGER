### WHAT IS KEYLOGGER ? 
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a keyboard. It can be used for legitimate purposes like monitoring employee productivity or tracking user activity on a computer, but it is also commonly used for malicious purposes such as stealing passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.
